# Activity_Recognition

For the final project(CCTV Platfom)

# Algorithm

* Web Platform

Web UI is front-end of this project.
This web UI helps platform more easy to use.

* SSD_LSTM

This algorithm detects actions(fight, punch, shoot).
When it detects specified actions, it alerts to web platform as soon as it detected.
This algorithm offers immediate response to criminal

* Raspberry pi

This part is used to implement alert.
From Raspberry pi LED sensor, we can implement immediate alert when
SSD_LSTM algorithm detect specific actions(fight, punch, shoot)
